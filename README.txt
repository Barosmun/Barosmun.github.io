This site was made for Project03 in Dr. Dan Pittman's World Wide Web Programming I [COMP3410] class.
The project is meant to expand on Project01 and 02, as well as serve as a summary of what I've learned in the class.

The site is comprised of HTML5, JavaScript (jQuery), and -as added in this update- CSS3.

Most Awesome:
  My homepage will display and name a random country's flag. It's a jQuery script pulling from a JSON array of Wikipedia image URLs.
  I originally wanted to pull from a CSV, but that proved somewhat complicated in JavaScript.
  Not wanting to implement something in python, I converted the file to a JSON.
  Chrome threw a fit about me pulling data from a local file, so in order to bypass that I hosted the file on my personal site.
  The script pulls from the online JSON, but I've included the original file for reference.


With more time I'd like to improve the versatility of the site and implement some viewport stuff.
