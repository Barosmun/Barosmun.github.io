                Liftman is a surreal  point-and-click adventure about a college student just trying to get
                to class who gets mistaken for the new multidimensional elevator operator!
                Figure out where your guests need to go in a timely fashion, or you might not make it out alive...
                either way you'll probably still be late for biology!

                 Having accidentally teleported into a strange dimension,
                 Aniyah and GC-46 find themselves trapped in a labyrinth of wires
                 and monsters. Their only hope is an AI that controls the facility.
                 The AI, named G_MA, offers to help if Aniyah and GC-46 can restore power.
                 Aniyah and GC-46 must find these nodes quickly as G_MA can only keep the
                 lights on for so long on her dwindling power. Escape the facility and return to your mission!

                   A sole wanderer travels across the barren wastes. Her carrier spits and sputters,
                   running on fumes, begging for a break. Suddenly, the grand machine's
                   gears grind to a halt, and the once magnificent and proud creature becomes a target.
                   At night, the natives take notice, and begin their swarming for the feast. You must
                   defend your transport and also repair it, or face your doom as another bleached skeleton in the dunes.

                    You decide to seek a solution, and wind up in an experimental
                    procedure that visually constructs your greatest weaknesses.
                    Will you overcome your primal reaction to run, or will you conquer your own mind.
